# PausePagrForAGame
This is a simple pause page for a game that uses a few functions to create and animate "divs" that enter the window from random positions and fall to the bottom.I was experimenting with adding .mp3 funtionality but it doesn't work at present.  I have a random color generator module that I might add to the <body> of perhaps the <div> squares or maybe both. Who knows?
